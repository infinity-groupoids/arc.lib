LIBRARY: arc.lib  - Compute equations of generalized arc/jet schemes

AUTHOR:  Andrew R. Stout (astout@bmcc.cuny.edu)

DESCRIPTION:
  Computes the equations of a generalized arc space of a scheme defined by ideal I
  relative to a fat point defined by ideal J, with respect to a list of ambient variables.
  Optionally, a skip list of coefficient indices can be provided.

PROCEDURES:
  arc(I, J, optList)   return list of equations of a generalized arc space
";

LIB "arc.lib";

// ======================================================================
// Main user-facing procedure
// ======================================================================
proc arc(ideal I, ideal J, list optList)
"USAGE:
  arc(I, J, optList);

INPUT:
  I       ideal defining the base scheme X
  J       ideal defining the fat point G embedded in the same ambient ring
  optList list of positive integers (optional) indicating coefficient indices to skip

RETURN:
  A ring S whose ideal arcideal contains the defining equations of the generalized arc space
  in the coefficient variables a1, a2, ...

EXAMPLE:
  ring R = 0, (x,y), dp;
  ideal I = x4 + y3;
  ideal J = x2, y2;
  def s = arc(I, J, list());
  setring s; 
  ideal A = arcideal; A;
